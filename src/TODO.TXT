Immediate Enchancements
-----------------------

- find a way to get rid of focus border on buttons
- try to give the window a background (must be a light colour, lest fingerprints become a lot more visible)
- remove 'insert disk and', instead add a check + a new window asking for disk
- make obvious that buttons are clickable (maybe background colour/picture)
- freedos?
- move mouse pointer to a corner after an operation starts/ends so it doesn't hightlight a button
- at least some kind of trivial exception handling to return to the main window or something

- put xorg.conf in this dir
- list of available software on the website
- picture and address on the main page
- make a util folder with xfce start scripts

Future
------

- Include the facility to make USB bootable drives, More eco friendly.
- Include the facility to write multiple ISO to DVDs, or copy to pen drive.
- Setup network boot, so that the user can install from network
- Add a GUI to add the XML file and the logo of a new distro.
- Get the details of distro automaticaly from distro watch
