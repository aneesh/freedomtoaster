- find a way to get rid of focus border on buttons
- try to give the window a background (must be a light colour, lest fingerprints become a lot more visible)
- remove 'insert disk and', instead add a check + a new window asking for disk
- make obvious that buttons are clickable (maybe background colour/picture)
-freedos?
- move mouse pointer to a corner after an operation starts/ends so it doesn't hightlight a button
- at least some kind of trivial exception handling to return to the main window or something

- put xorg.conf in this dir
- list of available software on the website
- picture and address on the main page
- make a util folder with xfce start scripts
