<description>Damn Small Linux 4.4 is a Small Linux is a very versatile 50MB mini desktop oriented Linux distribution.</description>
<longdescription>Damn Small is small enough and smart enough to do the following things:

    * Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution (LiveCD)
    * Boot from a USB pen drive
    * Boot from within a host operating system (that's right, it can run *inside* Windows)
    * Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call "frugal install"
    * Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install
    * Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram
    * Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB (you will be amazed at how fast your computer can be!)
    * Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to customize


DSL was originally developed as an experiment to see how many usable desktop applications can fit inside a 50MB live CD.</longdescription>
