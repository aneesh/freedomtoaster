Slackware Linux provides new and experienced users alike with a fully-featured system, equipped to serve in any capacity from desktop workstation to machine-room server. Web, ftp, and email servers are ready to go out of the box, as are a wide selection of popular desktop environments. A full range of development tools, editors, and current libraries is included for users who wish to develop or compile additional software. 

Slackware's latest stable x86 release is 12.2[12] (as of 2008-12-10), which includes support for ALSA, GCC 4.2.4, Linux 2.6.27.7, KDE 3.5.10 and Xfce 4.4.3.[12]

Slackware is primarily developed for the x86 architecture.
