<description>Sabayon Linux (formerly known as RR4 Linux/RR64 Linux) is a Gentoo-based operating system.</description>
<longdescription>
Both Sabayon and Gentoo allow users to install the base system using binary packages, but Sabayon also includes a binary package manager, and is in general more flexible towards the use of pre-compiled packages than Gentoo is. Sabayon supports the x86 and x86-64 architectures.

Sabayon Linux is distributed as a Live Distro with options to install to the hard disk. A feature named "Entropy" incorporates the binary package manager through GUI program called "Spritz" or a console program called "equo" into the distribution. Many binaries have already been made available and the command "equo" for command-line interpretation of Entropy is in beta stage.

Sabayon Linux is available with the KDE, Xfce and GNOME desktop environments, and Fluxbox.
