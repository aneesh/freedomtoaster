Pardus Aims

    * To provide full Turkish support by making the character structure compatible to Turkish (UTF-8 compatibility) and by making all the messages and documents visible to users into Turkish.
    * To ensure that it is an operating system which can be installed and used more easily than the existing Linux distributions and other competitive operating systems.
    * Designing its in a modular configuration which can achieve the required flexibility and high performance with a task-based and human-focused approach rather than a tool-based and technology-based one.</longdescription>
